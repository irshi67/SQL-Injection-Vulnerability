## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Lombok
- JDBC
- PostgreSQL
- Thymeleaf (for the front-end)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Apache Maven (for building the project)
- PostgreSQL database server

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/irshi67/SQL-Injection-Vulnerability
   ```

2. Configure the PostgreSQL database connection in the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdatabase
    spring.datasource.username=yourusername
    spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080/login` and `http://localhost:8080/registration`.

### Security Best Practices
`This Java project has been created to demonstrate SQL Injection vulnerabilities.`
- Always use prepared statements or parameterized queries when interacting with the database to prevent SQL injection.
- Avoid directly interpolating user inputs into SQL queries.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive resources.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
